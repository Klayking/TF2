07:35 PM - irie|| Auto-Bot: Mix or 6v6, 6 players vs 6 players
The class limits are 1 demo 1 medic and 2 of the rest usual class loadouts are 2 scouts 2 soldiers 1 demo and 1 medic with scouts off classing to snipers or pyro or spy.
Anybody is welcome to play a mix as long as you take tf2 seriously and have at least a few hours behind the game to be able to play
only 12 people can be playing while the rest have to spectate if someone disconnects then someone speccing may take their place until the person comes back.
How a mix works
wait for 12 people to join the server everybody spectates 2 captains nominate themselves or get nominated(captains must know what classes everybody plays and their skill level) they have a melee fight at middle the winner picks somebody then the loser until everybody is picked(only the 1st 12 to arrive)
then captain assigns classes, do not change unless instructed teams ready up and rollout to mid must be known.
Some definitions that confused me when I started
Pills/pipes:demo grenades
Grind: purposefully damaging self to speed up ubercharge build
pocket: the soldier/demo you will uber and stay with
roam: the other soldier(takes alternate routes with scouts)
If you are new to mixes the best place to start is medic or scout
07:35 PM - irie|| Auto-Bot: 6v6 tips, every one know roll out of all maps, where health and ammo packs are
at mid roam solly must jump the med and 1 scout(2nd best scout) attack the demo while the best scout defends own demo
once captured mid 1 scout go ahead, other scout and roam stay on flanks! do not over extend stay alive! you need to feed info to see who is where and if it is safe to start attacking 2nd to last
if we win mid and kill the whole other team scouts go to 2nd to last while rest of team cap mid(maybe 1 scout stay at mid if some of our players are down)
after capping mid stay at mid until we have uber again then we can push in again to cap the next point do not just attack move in a group, maybe one scout off class to sniper if they can consistently get head shots(on attack) and for defending last a scout go heavy
scouts always use flanks with roam so scouts and roam are a team in a team and demo pocket and med are the other team in a team
always check scoreboard know who plays what so you can make calls if nobody else has made the call( demo down etc) always make calls on what you see whos where, where sticky traps are/could be (if demo is down that isnt important)
on mid 2nd best scout must know killing other demo takes priority do not suicide but distract him so he cannot spam and has to divert attacks to you 
scouts work together but stay away from each other as a solly rocket will damage you both if you staying and working as 1, have a common goal(kill med for example) but stay away from each other
youtube pro 6v6 games watch the lines they take and how they position themselves listen to commentators they often point out mistakes
listen to captain do not attack aimlessly as I said above once a point is capped wait until uber is built up before another attack(if they defending that point) scouts stay on flanks and make calls on if they attack with the roam if you can kill them great that means we are 1 up makes it easier to attack
if you are playing a better scout then you are draw them in and let roam kill the
