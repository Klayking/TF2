[13:02] <ZoidbergWill> Hey jukkan
[13:02] <ZoidbergWill> Will changing the fullstop's to exlamation marks break anything?
[15:34] <jukkan> fullstop?
[15:34] <jukkan> you mean like change .add to !add
[15:34] <jukkan> ?
[15:36] <jukkan> you also need to change the '.' to '!' on line 325
[15:36] <jukkan> and unfortunately, do to same for every command 
[15:36] <jukkan> i didn't think anyone would want to change it
[15:37] <jukkan> so it's kind of hard coded
[15:37] <jukkan> and a command like .rank and .top are combined inside one block 
[15:38] <jukkan> so there's an if-else statement that if the command is .rank or .top
[15:38] <jukkan> so those dots need to be changed too
[15:39] <jukkan> but there's no logical explanation why you would even want to do that, except if those commands clash with some other bot's commands that you might have
[15:39] <jukkan> dot is much faster to write than !
[15:47] <jukkan> the first character should actually be parsed out of the first command right after line 325
[15:47] <jukkan> so it wouldn't have to be taken into account later
[15:48] <jukkan> like change .example to example
[15:48] <jukkan> and then later just have if ($commands[0] eq 'example') instead of if ($commands[0] eq '.example)
[15:49] <jukkan> so the first character could be changed from one place
[20:03] <ZoidbergWill> Ahhh
[20:03] <ZoidbergWill> It is just cuz conventionally here they are !'s
[20:03] <ZoidbergWill> Even though .'s are faster.
[20:04] <ZoidbergWill> I don't mind changing them all, I can do taht
[20:04] <ZoidbergWill> *that
