TF2.git
============
https://github.com/zoidbergwill/TF2

CFG's, Useful Links, and random incomplete stuff.

My scripts are in "custom scripts"
and my SourceMod plugins are in "custom SM plugins"

This is a repository I use to publish and share my SourceMod plugins, and other stuff that interests people.

IRC Bots I am considering and configuring for TF2 in South Africa are here.
