Hey.
Just checking if you have the new maps that we wanna play in mixes, in addition to the usual 4 or 5.

ftp://184.22.121.73/Maps/Competitive/Current%20Rotation/cp_snakewater.zip


Installing Custom Maps:
	Step 1: Download all 3 maps.
Step 2: Unzip the maps.
Step 3: Copy the unzipped maps to "Steam/steamapps/username/team fortress 2/tf/maps
	(Where username is your Steam username of course)


Also tr_walkway is there, if you are interested in practising and don't have it:

Thanks, and I appreciate it if you have the maps or are downloading them now.
